# budget-tracker

## Description
This application lets users keep track of a running balance in any account. You're able to add income as well as subtract any money leaving the account. What makes this app special is that we've implemented offline functionality. So you're able to use the app like normal even without service or wifi. And once you return to having a solid connection your app will just continue like normal without deleting what was done during offline usage. Budget-tracker uses IndexedDB, Service workers and web manifest. You can also find the deployed version of the app on heroku at 

## Installation
You're able to clone this repo and install dependencies. The script used to start up server is `npm start`.
## Usage
Initialize the starting balance using the 'Add Funds' button. One by one input your transaction name/type along with the dollar amount. Once those are filled out press either 'Add Funds' or 'Subtract Funds' depending on the type of transaction being carried out. And you will instantly see the total balance reflect whatever transaction. 

Here's a screen shot of what the app looks like in use:
